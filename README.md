# WordleStats
Welcome to the WordleStats Discord bot. This bot will allow you and the members of your Discord
server to track and view statistics for your daily Wordle scores.

## How Does it Work?
WordleStats makes use of Discord's [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) to provide you with an easy way to interact with the bot once
it's added to your server.

### Commands
Start by typing a `/` to use one of the following commands:

#### `/add [puzzle] [guesses]` - [Full Documentation](docs/add.md)
Adds a new Wordle score to your stats, or changes the score you have saved if you've already
provided a score for that puzzle.

#### `/stats [user]` - [Full Documentation](docs/stats.md)
Displays the Wordle stats for a given user.

#### `/help`
Displays helpful information about how to use WordleStats.
